Mobile App Developer
--------------------

I'm a passionate mobile developer focused on building modern Android applications using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I enjoy creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces while following best practices in architecture and code structure. I continuously explore the Android ecosystem, working with tools and libraries like Room, Retrofit, Hilt, and Coroutines to build scalable and maintainable apps. Whether it's building from scratch or improving existing codebases, I aim to write efficient and reliable code that enhances the user experience. I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.
